# Project info
This is a simple project (a blog), which I'm currently working on, in order to practice some newly learned programming concepts and patterns.

What is all about:
- .NET Core 3.0 Web API
- asynchronous (async / await)
- unit tests and integration tests (NUnit, Moq, FluentAssertions)
- IoC (Autofac)
- CQRS
- mapping between domain models and DTOs (AutoMapper)
- clean project architecture
